# hangman

This is a simple hangman game that I created while learning how to code in Python. I am currently going through the book "Python Projects for Begginers: A Ten-Week Bootcamp Approach to Python Programming" and this is the project from week 04. 

I did deviate a bit from the source code in the book. The changes implemented:

1. A Play again feature. Players can play multiple games and it will never use the same word again.
2. Once the player gets the last letter in the word. It congrats the player immediately rather than needing one more guess input.
